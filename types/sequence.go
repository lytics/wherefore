// Difference defines an ordering for comparing TCP sequences that's safe for
// roll-overs.  It returns:
//    > 0 : if t comes after s
//    < 0 : if t comes before s
//      0 : if t == s
// The number returned is the sequence difference, so 4.Difference(8) will
// return 4.
//
// It handles rollovers by considering any sequence in the first quarter of the
// uint32 space to be after any sequence in the last quarter of that space, thus
// wrapping the uint32 space.
