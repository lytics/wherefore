project goals
-------------

* HoneyBadger is primarily a comprehensive TCP stream analysis tool for detecting and recording TCP attacks. Perhaps it can assist in discovering 0-days and botnets.

* HoneyBadger will include a variety of TCP stream injections attacks (it now includes 2) which prove that the TCP attack detection is reliable.


details
-------

* Read about HoneyBadger's design and implementation: https://honeybadger.readthedocs.org/

* Read the `manual integration procedure`_ - a reproduciable procedure which proves HoneyBadger's TCP injection attack detection is reliable; **in less than 2 minutes you can perform a test on your loopback interface... and test that HoneyBadger can detect injected data into a netcat client-server connection.**

* Read the godoc `autogenerated API documentation`_

usage note
----------
It is not a good idea to run network traffic analysis tools as root.
In Linux you can run these tools as an unprivileged user after you run setcap as root like this::

   # setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip honeyBadger
